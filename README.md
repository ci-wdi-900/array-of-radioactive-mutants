# Array of Radioactive Mutants

### Guidelines

Remember that you won't be `return`-ing in this set of functions, just mutating the original array. Check `main.test.js` to see how we're using your function--we just pass in an array and then check if that array now contains the set of values we expected.

### Setup

This is a typical test-based assignment, so:

1. Fork and clone
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run test`

### Challenges

1. `addMeToEnd` - adds the string 'Colin' to the end of the given array.
2. `addMeToStart` - adds the string 'Colin' to the start of the given array.
3. `changeLast` - _changes_ (not adds!) the last value in the given array to the value given.
4. `changeAllValuesTo` - changes _every_ value in the given array to the given value.
5. `oddOrEven` - changes every numerical value in the given array (you can assume they'll all be numbers) to the string 'odd' if the number is odd and 'even' if it's even.
6. `changeNextThreeToValue` - starting with the given index, changes three consecutive values in the given array to the given value. Note the order of our 3 parameters, and check the tests if you're unsure.
